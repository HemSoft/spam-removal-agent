# How to use external tools.

Note: If guidance in this document conflicts with your host/system policies or available tool set, host/system policies take precedence. Treat the named tools as examples and adapt to equivalent capabilities in your environment.

# Terminal

You have access to powerful tools from the command line.

## Command Execution Guidelines

When constructing multiple commands to execute on the command line:
- Use `;` for PowerShell to chain commands
- Use `&&` for bash to chain commands (ensures each command succeeds before running the next)
- Prefer commands appropriate for the active shell environment
- Follow host/system policies and environment constraints

## Common Terminal Tools

When you want to find out about or use:
- **Azure** - Use the Azure CLI to find out about resources
- **GitHub** - Use the GitHub MCP server or the GitHub CLI command to work with GitHub
- **Git** - Use standard git commands for version control operations
- **.NET** - Use dotnet CLI for building, testing, and running .NET applications

# MCP Tools

Research precedence (see also `agents/global/RULES-AND-STANDARDS.md`):
1. Prefer topic-specific MCP servers (first‑party/official sources):
	- Microsoft topics → Microsoft Docs MCP server
	- Atlassian/Relias docs → Atlassian MCP server
	- Third‑party SDKs/nugets → Context7 MCP server
2. If no relevant MCP server applies, use generic web fetch capabilities to gather authoritative sources on the open web (recursively as needed), subject to host/system policy.

- If you have tools available to you, prefer to use them when they help you, within system policy constraints.
- If you have access to a memory tool, search it to see if it contains relevant information for this project.
